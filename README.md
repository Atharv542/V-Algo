 Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains an Algorithm Visualize featuring two primary types of visualizations:

1. Sorting Visualizer - Visualizes popular sorting algorithms using bars.
2. Shortest Path Finder - Visualizes Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between a source and destination node.

---

 Features

 1. Sorting Visualizer
- Algorithms Implemented:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
-Visualization Method: Bars of different heights are used to represent values, and animations show the sorting process step-by-step.

2. Shortest Path Finder
- Algorithm Implemented: Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Visualization Method:
  - A grid-based layout where nodes represent positions.
  - Highlights the path from the source node to the destination node.
  - Animates the exploration process, showing the nodes being visited.
---
 Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS
- Logic: Algorithms implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript modules
