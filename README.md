# Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains an **Algorithm Visualizer** featuring two primary types of visualizations:

1. **Sorting Visualizer** - Visualizes popular sorting algorithms using bars.
2. **Shortest Path Finder** - Visualizes Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between a source and destination node.

---

## Features

### 1. Sorting Visualizer
- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Visualization Method:** Bars of different heights are used to represent values, and animations show the sorting process step-by-step.

### 2. Shortest Path Finder
- **Algorithm Implemented:** Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Visualization Method:**
  - A grid-based layout where nodes represent positions.
  - Highlights the path from the source node to the destination node.
  - Animates the exploration process, showing the nodes being visited.



---

## Usage
- **Sorting Visualizer:**
  - Select the desired sorting algorithm from the menu.
  - Adjust the speed and size of the array using the provided sliders.
  - Click the 'Sort' button to start visualization.

- **Shortest Path Finder:**
  - Select the source and destination nodes.
  - Click 'Visualize' to visualize the shortest path.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS
- **Logic:** Algorithms implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript modules

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms (Heap Sort, Radix Sort, etc.).
- Implement additional pathfinding algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS).
- Enhance animations and visual effects.
